# slooo: The DepFast Fail-slow Injection Testing Infrastructure

This is a new repo for the depfast slow-injection testing infrastructure. It will be a new build from scratch.

The old code can be found at: https://github.com/WolfDOS/depfast-inj

The goal of this project is to build a generic, reusable testing infrastructure that can be effectively used for any distributed systems (we can start from Raft or other consensus systems), rather than a bunch of ad hoc scripts.

IMPORTANT:  
Only works with Microsoft Azure (so far).
