# Slooo: A Fail-slow Fault Injection Testing Infra

Slooo is a Xonsh-based fault injection framework for distributed systems.

Slooo is a part of [the DepFast project](https://tianyin.github.io/pub/depfast.pdf) in which we evaluate the fail-slow fault tolerance of a quorum system using fault injection, e.g., slowing down a node by adding delays and creating contention on the CPU/memory/disk.

Doing such fault injection requires a lot of scripting. Some are application specific (e.g., scripts to start and terminate the system) and some are generic (e.g., injecting certain types of faults).

We started with shell scripts for fast scripting, but soon we found it to be hard to maintain the shell scripts over time, especially every time there is a major reorgs of the team (members leaving and joining). After many rounds of bitterness and time wasting, we decided to write a more structured, reusable framework to minimize the overhead.

The choice of using [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/) comes from the following considerations:
* We still need shell scripts for the ease of integration. Specifically, many of the scripts of the system under test are in shell.
* We want high-level languages which can build some abstractions and reusable code.

Xonsh serves both â€“ it is a chimera of Python and Shell.

We have used Slooo to test a number of quorum systems, including RethinkDB, MongoDB, TiDB, and Copilot.

Slooo supports both a `pseudo-distributed` mode and a `cloud` mode. The former runs all the tests on one machine (or VM) and the latter runs the tests in a cloud environment. Currently, we only support Azure Cloud (which sponsored the DepFast project).
